                            <p><span class="first-character sc">I</span>n 1978, Brian Smith landed in Southern
                                California with a bag
                                of
                                sheepskin boots and hope. He fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was
                                convinced the world
                                would one day share this love. The beaches of Southern California had long been an
                                epicenter of a
                                relaxed, casual lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit for his brand.
                                So he
                                founded
                                the UGG brand, began selling his sheepskin boots and they were an immediate sensation.
                                By the mid
                                1980's, the UGG brand became a symbol of relaxed southern California culture, gaining
                                momentum
                                through
                                surf shops and other shops up and down the coast of California, from San Diego to Santa
                                Cruz. UGG
                                boots
                                reached beyond the beach, popping up in big cities and small towns all over, and in
                                every level of
                                society. Girls wore their surfer boyfriend's pair of UGG boots like a letterman jacket.
                                When winter
                                came
                                along, UGG boots were in ski shops and were seen in lodges from Mammoth to Aspen.</p>
                            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                            <p class="margin-top-10">The UGG brand began to symbolize those who embraced sport and a
                                relaxed, active
                                lifestyle. More than that, an emotional connection and a true feeling of love began to
                                grow for UGG
                                boots, just as Brian had envisioned. People didn't just like wearing UGG boots, they
                                fell in love
                                with
                                them and literally could not take them off. By the end of the 90's, celebrities and
                                those in the
                                fashion
                                world took notice of the UGG brand. A cultural shift occurred as well - people were
                                embracing, and
                                feeling empowered, by living a more casual lifestyle and UGG became one of the symbols
                                of this
                                lifestyle. By 2000, a love that began on the beaches had become an icon of casual style.
                                It was at
                                this
                                time that the love for UGG grew in the east, over the Rockies and in Chicago. In 2000,
                                UGG Sheepskin
                                boots were first featured on Oprah's Favorite Things® and Oprah emphatically declared
                                that she
                                "LOOOOOVES her UGG boots." From that point on, the world began to notice.</p>

                                the early 2000's, UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a
                                brand that
                                made
                                sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand
                                that was
                                now
                                being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of
                                this was
                                due to
                                a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker.
                                As a
                                fashion
                                brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other
                                fashion books. In
                                the
                                mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and
                                UGG was now
                                perfectly aligned with this movement.</p>

                            <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and

                                love for UGG
                                increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began

                                were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed,
                                showcasing
                                everything

                                coast to coast.
                                Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

                                along with the
                                stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were
