                            <p><span class="first-character sc">F</span>rom my early days in Kenya to becoming a seasoned professional in the world of technology and coding, my path has been
                            one of relentless dedication and unwavering passion.
                            
                            I first encountered the digital realm at a young age, even before my relocation to the United States. My innate
                            curiosity led me to explore coding languages such as Lua, HTML, and CSS. I honed my skills and crafted my first website
                            before reaching middle school. This early introduction to web development foreshadowed a lifelong fascination with
                            technology.</p>
                            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                            <p class="margin-top-10">However, my journey was not confined to code alone. My entrepreneurial spirit emerged as I established my own service,
                            providing doorstep electronics repair services to my community. This initiative underscored my commitment to delivering
                            technical solutions and ingrained in me the value of customer-centricity.
                            
                            Upon arriving in the United States, my passion for technology continued to flourish. I ventured into iOS app
                            development, creating two successful applications that demonstrated my innovation and mastery of mobile software
